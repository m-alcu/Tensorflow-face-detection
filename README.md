# Tensorflow face detection

Tensorflow face detection implementation based on Mobilenet SSD V2, trained on Wider face dataset using Tensorflow object detection API.


## Dependencies

* Tensorflow 2
* OpenCv
* imutils

Previously has to be installed: https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git
nd follow all these instructions: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```
python face_detection_webcam.py
```

## Docker


```
docker build -t face_detection .
```

Run the project with pre-trained model :

```
bash runDetection.sh
```

## Result 
Achieves 19 FPS with a 640x480 resolution on Intel Core i7-7600U CPU 2.80GHz Ã— 4 U.
